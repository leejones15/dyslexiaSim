    <h1>The Lost Kitten</h1>

    <div id="story">
        <p id="s1">
            <span class="bold">Mia loved animals. She had a dog named Max and a fish named Bubbles. One rainy afternoon, Mia heard a soft "meow" outside her window.</span> 
            She looked out and saw a tiny, wet kitten hiding under a bush.
        </p>

        <p id="s1">
            <span class="bold">"Oh no! You must be cold and scared," Mia said.</span> 
            She ran outside with an umbrella. Carefully, she picked up the shivering kitten and carried it inside. She wrapped it in a warm towel and gave it a little bowl of milk.
        </p>

        <p id="s2">
            <span class="bold">Mia’s mom helped her dry the kitten’s fur. "We should see if someone lost their pet," her mom said.</span> 
            They made posters with a picture of the kitten and put them around the neighborhood.
        </p>

        <p id="s2">
            <span class="bold">A day later, Mia got a call. "That’s my kitten, Whiskers!" a boy named Jake said.</span> 
            He had been looking everywhere. Mia felt a little sad to say goodbye, but she knew the kitten belonged with Jake.
        </p>

        <p id="s3">
            <span class="bold">When Jake came to get Whiskers, he smiled. "Thank you for taking care of her!" he said.</span> 
            Mia smiled too. She was happy Whiskers was safe.
        </p>

        <p id="s3">
            <span class="bold">That night, as she cuddled with Max, Mia thought about how good it felt to help someone.</span>
